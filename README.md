## About
Rush Hour is a web traffic tracking and analysis tool that analyzes HTTP request information for clients.  It allows a client to gain information about their users, particularly, how the site is being used and accessed.   Allows a client to register their site, accepts client data via POST request to a dedicated endpoint, and provides analytics at site and individual URL level.

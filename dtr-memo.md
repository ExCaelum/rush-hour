# Rush Hour

#### Parker Phillips, Brian Sayler

* What does each group member hope to get out of the project? What are your goals and expectations for the project?     

Parker - I would like to learn active record, and experience a partnership with a similar skill levels.  

Brian - I would like to get practice with basic project management, working smart. Deliberate work time.

* When are group members available to work together?... What hours can each group member work individually? Are there any personal time commitments that need to be discussed?      

I can stay after school until 5:30 to 6:30 most nights. Thursday night is unavailable. Solo work time in the evenings if there is work to be done. After wrap-up be clear on what needs to be done with the rest of the day.

* How will group members communicate? How often will communication happen, and how will open lines of communication be maintained?

Communication will be held through slack most times, after wrap-up daily. Open lines will be held through slack, phone if it is urgent.

* What is each group memberâ€™s self-identified strength(s) technically? What does each group member want to improve on technically? How can the team assist with these improvements?

Parker - Bootstrap and Ruby are my strongest areas. Custom CSS, complex HTML, and feature testing are my weak.

Brian - HTTP verbs, hashes, and some experience with HAML are my strengths. Improve on database queries, more practice with bootstrap

* Which feature(s) does each group member want to work on? Which feature(s) does each group member not want to work on?

Parker - I don't really have a preference for features

Brian - ^^^

* What is the agreed upon Git workflow? What project management tool will be used? What is the agreed upon procedure for conducting code reviews before merging into master: who will review pull requests, and when?

Heavily use branches, only commit to master together when everything is clean. Iteration branches off of master, each memeber has their own branch off of that iteration's branch. Merge to the iteration branch together.

* What is expected of group members when they run into problems implementing a feature?

Don't stay up all night trying to figure something out. Seek help outside of the group to help you move forward, if that doesn't help then reach out to group memebers.

* How does each group member want feedback (both positive and constructive) to be delivered?

Brutally Honest, but don't be a dick. If we see that we are not taking progress, say something and take a break.

* Is there anything else the group should know about personal work/communication styles?

Parker - I'm not a morning person, I tend to front-load the workload.

Brian - Work Smarter not harder, needs time at night.
